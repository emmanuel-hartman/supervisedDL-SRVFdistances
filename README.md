# supervisedDL-SRVFdistances
A supervised DL framework for computing pairwise SRV elastic shape distances between curves as defined in *Supervised deep learning of elastic SRV distances on the shape space of curves*. This code includes functions to define a Keras model and train the model with shape-preserving data augmentation.

# Requirements

Our code is written in Python and includes the following Python libraries:

  -Numpy

  -Scipy

  -TensorFlow

  -Keras

# Usage

A Jupyter Notebook called *Examples.ipynb* has been included with examples of usage of our main functions. This covers our functions that declare a Keras model with the structure outlined in *Supervised deep learning of elastic SRV distances on the shape space of curves*, train the network using shape-preserving data augmentation, and generate random curves from the same shape class as another curve. Further, in the Jupyter Notebook called *TrainedNetworks.ipynb* we outline how to use one of our pre-trained networks (included in the Data folder) to compute a distance between two curves. 


# Trained Networks

In the *TrainedNetworks* folder we include two networks, defined and trained in our framework. The first, called *Model_Synthetic1.h5* was trained on open, real-valued functions discretized at 90 points from our Synthetic I data set. Model_Synthetic1 was trained for 500 epochs with parameters trainsize=10000 and reparamn=10. We plot the mean squared error of this model on the training data as well as on unseen testing data. The second, called *Model_Kimia.h5* was trained on closed, 2-dimensional curves discretized at 100 points from the Kimia dataset. Model_Kimia was trained for 50 epochs with parameters trainsize=10000 and reparamn=10. We illustrate the usage of these frameworks in the Jupyter Notebook called *TrainedNetworks.ipynb*.
